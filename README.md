# Simple Dynamic Table with sorting and filter

Demonstrating ability of ngTempalteOutlet to create highly customizable table.
There can more things added and can event pass all functions directly through parent component itself and
leave rendering to table itself while application can do it's sorting selection and filtering logic and customized rows.

things can be changed like PrimeNg library as well which they are creating directive for sorting and emit sorting event , similarly for filter and checkbox they have seperate element to handle that based on passed configuration which seems to be better way for longterm as functionality increases
